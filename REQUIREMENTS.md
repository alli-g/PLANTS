## Requirements

The requirements below are broken into separate **tiers**, which model the way we **recommend you approach the project**. That is, we recommend you complete (or complete the majority of) the requirements in Tier 1 before moving on to Tier 2, and so on. Of course, if you get stuck on a particular feature, we recommend moving on and trying another feature - don't sacrifice the good for the perfect!

### Bonus Tier (25 EC)

<details>

#### Finishing Touches

- [ ] If a user attempts to add a new robot or project without a required field, a helpful message should be displayed
- [ ] If a user attempts to access a page that doesn't exist (ex. `/potato`), a helpful "not found" message should be displayed
- [ ] If a user attempts to view a robot/project that doesn't exist, a helpful message should be displayed
- [ ] Whenever a component needs to wait for data to load from the server, a "loading" message should be displayed until the data is available
- [ ] Overall, the app is spectacularly styled and visually stunning

#### Ordering

- [ ] Create option for projects to be ordered based on priority on all-projects view
- [ ] Create option for projects to be ordered based on deadline on all-projects view
- [ ] Create option for robots to be ordered based on fuel level on all-robots view

#### Filtering

- [ ] Create filters on all-projects view so that projects can be filtered based completion status and priority (allow multiple filters to be applied)
- [ ] Create a filter on all-robots view to only show projects without assigned robots and vice versa
- [ ] Create filters on all-robots view so that robots can be filtered based on fuel type and fuel level (allow multiple filters to be applied)
- [ ] Create a filter on all-robots view to only show robots without assigned projects and vice versa

#### Seeding

- [ ] Seed 100+ robots and 100+ projects
- [ ] Implement pagination for robots (e.g. `/robots?page=1` shows the first ten robots, and `/robots?page=2` shows robots 11-20)
- [ ] Implement pagination for projects (e.g. `/projects?page=1` shows the first ten projects, and `/projects?page=2` shows robots 11-20)

#### Testing

- [ ] React (AllRobots): renders "No Robots" if passed no robots
- [ ] React (AllProjects): renders "No Projects" if passed no projects
- [ ] Redux (robots): returns the initial state by default
- [ ] Redux (projects): returns the initial state by default
- [ ] Sequelize (Robot): name must not be null or empty
- [ ] Sequelize (Project): deadline must be a valid date
- [ ] Navigation: navbar to navigate to home, robots
- [ ] Navigation: navbar to navigate to projects
- [ ] Seed File: creates at least one robot that has several projects
- [ ] Seed File: creates at least one project that has several robots
